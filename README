			    Array::Autojoin

[Partially excerpted from the POD.]

NAME
     Array::Autojoin -- arrayrefs that stringify as join(", ", @$it)

SYNOPSIS
       use Array::Autojoin;
       my $headword = "biscocho";
       my $gloss = mkarray("cookie", "biscuit");
       print "$headword\: $gloss.\n";

        # Prints "biscocho: cookie, biscuit.\n";

DESCRIPTION
     This extremely short and simple module provides one exported
     function, mkpath( ...items... ), which makes an arrayref
     (containing those items) belonging to a class that does
     nothing other than specifying to Perl that when you want the
     string value of that arrayref, instead of giving something
     like "ARRAY(0x171568f)", it returns a happy string
     consisting of join(', ', @$arrayref).

PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5.006.  There seems to be a minor bug in
Perl 5.005 that makes boolean context not work right; if you don't
mind that, then you can use this module under Perl 5.005, I think.


INSTALLATION

You install Array::Autojoin, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of this suite in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl

Or see perldoc perlmodinstall


DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in LAutojoin.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.  See ChangeLog for recent changes.


MACPERL INSTALLATION NOTES

You needn't bother with the makefiles.  Just make a Array directory
in your MacPerl site_lib or lib directory, and move Autojoin.pm into
there.
